A MeNH2 aqueous solution (40%, 19.9 mL, 230.5 mmol) was added dropwise to ethyl acetoacetate (9.7 mL, 76.8 mmol) in jacketed filter while stirring. The reaction was stirred at 0 °C for 3 h, and then diluted with CH2Cl2 (100 mL) and H2O (50 mL). The organic layer was separated, dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and concentrated at 30 °C to afford the enamine Yield: 658 mg, 92%; yellow oil.
