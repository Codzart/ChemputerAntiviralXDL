"In a 250 mL round bottom flask Benzoquinone (12.40 g, 0.11 mol) was dissolved in acetone (120 mL). The mixture was heated to 30 Â°C, a solution of ethyl-3-methyl amino crotonate (17.199 mL, 0.11 mol) was added dropwise upon stirring at this temperature for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo and the residue was purified by recrystallization with acetone to afford the product as solid."
