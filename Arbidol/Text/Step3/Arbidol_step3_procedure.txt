3 g of indole derivative was dissolved in 3.1 mL pyridine (3.0 eq.) and to the above solution was added 24.3 mL acetic anhydride (20 eq.). The reaction was stirred and heated to 150 Â°C. After 1 h, the reaction was allowed to cool back to rt before being diluted with ethyl acetate (40 mL). The mixture was washed with a solution of aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate (40 mL). The product was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 40 mL) and the combined organic layers were washed with water (40 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated under vacuum to afford the product as a white solid which was used without further purification.
