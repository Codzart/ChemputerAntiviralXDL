1.0 g of indole derivative was dissolved in carbon tetrachloride (100 mL) and Bromine (0.558 mL) was added to the above-stirred solution. After heating at 85 °C for 16 h, the reaction was cooled and 100 mL of sodium thiosulphate solution (10% w/v in water) was added and the mixture was stirred for 20 min at room temperature until the orange color disappeared. After this time, the reaction mixture was transferred into a separation funnel, the reactor was rinsed with 10 mL of carbon tetrachloride and the organic phase was separated and washed with water (2 x 100 mL), dried (MgSO4). The mixture was concentrated under vacuum at 40 °C and 40 mbar to afford a pale yellow solid, which was used without further purification (1.40 g).
