Potassium hydroxide (763 mg, 3.0 equiv.) was dissolved in methanol (16 mL) and to the above solution was added 0.7 mL of thiophenol (1 equiv.) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 min. After this time, the solution was cooled to 0 Â°C and 3.0 g of Bromo indole derivative in 24 mL dichloromethane was added. The reaction was stirred for 3 h before neutralization with 1.2 mL of acetic acid. The solvent was removed in vacuum and the product was purified on silica gel using 20% EtOAc in hexane to yield the title product as a pale yellow solid.
