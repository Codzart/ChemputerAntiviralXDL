47.1 g (0.098 mole) of Arbidol was dissolved in 280 mL of acetone while stirring and heated to 60 °C.  To the above solution was added 11 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The reaction mixture was cooled to 10 °C and the precipitate was filtered off and recrystallized from an acetone-methanol-hydrochloric acid (700:85:7.5) mixture. Yield: 45.1 g (86%) of hydrochloric acid of Arbidol.
