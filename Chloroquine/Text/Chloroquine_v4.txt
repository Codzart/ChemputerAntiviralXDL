1-diethylamino-4-aminopentane (15.3 ml, 0.08 mol) was added to 4,7-dichloroquinolene (10.5 g, 0.05 moles) with stirring. The reaction mixture was heated and stirred at 180Â°C for 7 hrs. The mixture was allowed to cool with continued stirring. 3M acetic acid (55 ml) was added with stirring, followed by 2M sodium hydroxide solution (100 ml). The resulting solution was extracted 3 times with diethyl ether (100 ml) dried with potassium carbonate and the ether was removed via rotary evaporation to give the crude product.
