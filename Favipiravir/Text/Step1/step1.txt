To a solution of 2-aminopyrazine (1.84 g, 19.4 mmol) in acetonitrile (15 mL) was added NCS (2.59 g, 19.4 mmol) in batches at room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred for 5 h, and filtered through celite. The filter cake was washed with ethyl acetate (20 mL × 2). The combined filtrate was concentrated under vacuum, and then saturated aqueous Na2CO3 solution (20 mL) was added. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous  Na2SO4, decolorized with activated charcoal (0.5 g), and concentrated. The residue was purified  by  chromatography  on  silica  gel  eluting  with  petroleum ether (PE)-ethyl acetate (EA) (10:1–2:1) to give a light-yellow solid (1.38 g, yield 55%).
