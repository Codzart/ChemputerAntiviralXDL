17 (1.1 g, 8.5 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (25 mL) followed by the addition of NBS (1.52 g, 8.5 mmol) in batches over a period of 15 min at room temperature. When the reaction was completed, saturated aqueous Na2CO3 solution (10 mL) was added. After stirring for 10 min, 100 mL of water was added and the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (100 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, decolorized with activated charcoal (0.5 g), and concentrated to give a yellow solid (1.53 g, yield 87%).
