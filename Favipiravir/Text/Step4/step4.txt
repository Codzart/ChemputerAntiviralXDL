To a solution of 19a (3 g, 20 mmol) in DCM (50 mL) at 0 °C was successively added TiCl4 (2.2 mL, 20 mmol) and tert-butyl nitrite (7.4 mL, 62 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h. When the reaction was completed monitored by TLC, the solvent was evaporated and the residue was treated with water (50 mL) and then extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 50 mL). The extract was dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated to give 8 as a white solid (2.8 g, yield 81%).
