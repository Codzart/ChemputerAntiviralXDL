Compound 8 (2.6 g, 15.0 mmol), KF (5.23 g, 90.0 mmol), and tetrabutylammonium bromide (1.93 g, 6.0 mmol) were dried under vacuum and charged in a teflon bottle. DMSO (20 mL) was next added and the reaction heated at 60 °C for 2.5–3 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, treated with water (80 mL) and extracted with diethyl ether (100 mL). The organic layer was washed with water (3 × 25 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and purified by chromatography on silica gel with PE/EA (50:1–10:1) as eluent to give 9 as a white solid (1.27 g, yield 60%).
