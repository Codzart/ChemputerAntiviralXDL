To a solution of 9 (1.4 g, 10 mmol) in THF (5 mL) was added concentrated hydrochloric acid (30 mL). The reaction mixture was heated at 60 Â°C for 1.5 h, then cooled to room temperature and evaporated under vacuum. The residue was purified by chromatography on silica gel with PE/EA as eluent to give 10 as a white solid (1.2 g, yield 75%).
