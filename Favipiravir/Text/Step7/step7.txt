10 (1.2 g, 7.5 mmol), sodium bicarbonate (3.8 g, 45.2 mmol) were added into a mixture of 1,4-dioxane (10 mL) and water (20 mL). The reaction mixture was heated at 60 °C for 8 h. When the reaction was completed, hydrochloric acid (30 mL, 3 M) was added to adjust the pH to 3–4. The precipitate was collected, dried in vacuum to give a light-yellow solid (0.83 g). The filtrate was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 50 mL). The organic layer was washed with brine (2 × 10 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated to give another portion (0.14 g) of the product. The total yield was 82%.
