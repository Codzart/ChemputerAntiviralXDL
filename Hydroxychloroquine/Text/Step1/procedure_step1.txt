A reactor was charged with sodium chloride (20 g), water (100 mL) and hydrochloric acid (100 mL, 120 g). The solution was heated to 100 to 105°C and acetyl butyrolactone (84.0 mL, 100 g, 0.78 mol) was added dropwise. The reaction was heated for 10 h at 102.5 °C. (based on OPR&D 2006, 10, 334-338). The reaction was cooled to room temperature and the resulting product was distilled. The yield of the product was 80 g.
