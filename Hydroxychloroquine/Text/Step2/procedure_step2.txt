A reactor was equipped with a Dean-Stark condenser. The reactor was charged with para-toluene sulphonic acid (1 g), ethylene glycol (36.0 mL, 40 g), cyclohexane (160 mL) and 1-chloro-4-pentanone (76.0 mL, 80.0 g). The reaction mixture was heated to 80 to 90Â° C for 22.5 h and water was removed azeotropically from the reaction mixture during that time. The reaction mass was cooled. Water (40 mL) was added to the reaction and the phases were  separated. The organic layer was transferred to a buffer flask. Distillation gave the oily product. The yield of the product was 100gms.
