Toluene (200ml) and 2-(ethylamino)ethan-1-ol (142 mL, 130 g, 1.46 mol) were added to 2-(3-chloropropyl)-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane (91.4 mL, 100 g, 0.607 mol). The reaction mass was heated to 125 to 130Â°C for 16.5 h. The reaction was cooled to room temperature. Water (10 mL) was added and the phases were separated. The organic phase was transferred to a buffer flask. Distillation gave the product 2-(ethyl(3-(2-methyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)propyl)amino)ethan-1-ol. The yield was 110 g.
