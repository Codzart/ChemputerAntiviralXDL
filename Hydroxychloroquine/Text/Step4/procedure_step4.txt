Water (100 mL) and conc. hydrochloric acid (10 mL) was added to ketal (100 g) (2-(ethyl(3-(2-methyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)propyl)amino)ethan-1-ol). The reaction mass was stirred for 4.5 hours at 35 Â° C. Then the reaction mixture was quenched with 50 % aq NaOH (10 mL). The phases were separated and the organic phase was transferred to a buffer flask. The yield of the product of Formula 1N was 100gm.
