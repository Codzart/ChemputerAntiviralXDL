A solution of 7-iodopyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-4-amine (2, 6.21 g, 23.9 mmol, 1 equiv) was suspended in tetrahydrofuran (150 mL) under an argon atmosphere. TMSCl (6.07 mL, 23.9 mmol, 2.00 equiv) was added and the resulting mixture was stirred for 10 min at room temperature. The solution was cooled to approximately 0 °C, and PhMgCl (2 M in tetrahydrofuran, 23.9 mL, 47.8 mmol, 2.00 equiv) was added slowly. The reaction mixture was stirred for approximately 20 min, and iPrMgCl (1 M in tetrahydrofuran, 25.1 mL, 25.1 mmol, 1.00 equiv) was then added while maintaining an internal reaction temperature below 5 °C. After 15 min, the reaction mixture was cooled to approximately –20 °C and a solution of 2,3,5-tri-O- benzyl-D-ribono-1,4-lactone (1, 10.0 g, 23.9 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in tetrahydrofuran (30 mL) was added slowly while maintaining an internal reaction temperature of approximately –20 °C. After 1 h, the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to 0 °C, and then quenched with methanol (20 mL) followed by acetic acid (20 mL) and water (20 mL). The resulting mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and was then concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting concentrate was partitioned between ethyl acetate (250 mL) and aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (1 M, 250 mL). The organic layer was separated and then washed with 10% aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (250 mL) and brine (250 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude residue was subjected to silica gel chromatography eluting with 0¬10% methanol in ethyl acetate to afford the mixture of isomers 3 (13.2 g, 41.5%) as an off-white solid.
