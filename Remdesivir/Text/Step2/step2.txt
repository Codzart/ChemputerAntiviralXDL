To a solution of (3R,4R,5R)-2-(4-aminopyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-3,4-bis(benzyloxy)-5- ((benzyloxy)methyl)tetrahydrofuran-2-ol (3, 57.9 g, 105 mmol, 1 equiv) in dichloromethane (100 mL) pre-cooled to –78 °C was added trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (18.3 mL, 206 mmol, 2.00 equiv). After the reaction was stirred for 10 min, TMSOTf (38.9 mL, 216 mmol, 2.10 equiv) was slowly added and the resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min at –78 °C. TMSCN (56.5 mL, 451 mmol, 4.00 equiv) was then added slowly and the mixture was stirred for 2 h. Triethylamine (50 mL) was added and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. Solid sodium bicarbonate (80 g) was then added followed by the slow addition of water (300 mL) and the resulting mixture was stirred for 10 min. The layers were then separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude residue was subjected to silica gel chromatography eluting with 40¬100% ethyl acetate in hexanes to afford the product 4 (58.9 g, 85%) as an off-white solid.
