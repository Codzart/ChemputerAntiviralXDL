Boron trichloride (1 M, 35.0 mL, 35.0 mmol, 3.80 equiv) was slowly added to a solution of (2R,3R,4R,5R)-2-(4-aminopyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-3,4-bis(benzyloxy)-5- ((benzyloxy)methyl)tetrahydrofuran-2-carbonitrile (4, 5.11 g, 9.10 mmol, 1 equiv) in anhydrous dichloromethane (50 mL) at –78 C under an argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to –40 C and was stirred for 2 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to –78 C and methanol (10 mL) was added dropwise. A solution of triethylamine (13 mL) in methanol (20 mL) was added dropwise and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. The resulting mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. The solid residue was slurried with hexanes (50 mL) and the supernatant was then decanted (3×). The remaining solid residue was suspended into methanol (50 mL) and was heated to 45 °C. Water (50 mL) was added, and the resulting mixture was concentrated at 45 °C under reduced pressure to remove the volatiles to a final volume of approximately 35 mL water. The mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and the fine white solids were collected by vacuum filtration and dried in an oven at 70 C overnight to afford the product Nuc (2.27 g, 86%).
