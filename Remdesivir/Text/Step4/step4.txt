Sulfuric acid (18 M, 1.4 mL, 26 mmol, 1.3 equiv) was added dropwise to a suspension of Nuc (5.8 g, 20 mmol, 1 equiv) and 2,2-dimethoxypropane (12 mL, 95 mmol, 4.8 equiv) in acetone (145 mL) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min, and was warmed to 45 °C. After 30 min, the reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature, and solid sodium bicarbonate (5.8 g) and water (5.8 mL) were sequentially added. The mixture was stirred for 15 min and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved into ethyl acetate (150 mL) and water (50 mL). The organic layer was separated and the water layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 50 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and then concentrated under reduced pressure to afford product 5 (6.54 g, 99%), which was used directly in the next step without further purification. Analytically pure samples of 5 could be obtained through silica gel chromatography eluting with ethyl acetate.
