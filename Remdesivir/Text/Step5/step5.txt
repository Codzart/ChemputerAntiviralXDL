Acetonitrile (16 mL) was added to a mixture of (2S)-2-ethylbutyl 2-(((4- nitrophenoxy)(phenoxy)phosphoryl)amino)propanoate (6, 1.79 g, 3.98 mmol, 1.20 equiv), (3aR,4R,6R,6aR)-4-(4-aminopyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-6-(hydroxymethyl)-2,2- dimethyltetrahydrofuro[3,4-d][1,3]dioxole-4-carbonitrile (5, 1.10 g, 3.32 mmol, 1 equiv), and magnesium chloride (316 mg, 3.32 mmol, 1.00 equiv) at room temperature. The solution was heated to 50 °C for 10 min, and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (1.45 mL, 8.30 mmol, 2.50 equiv) was added. After 20 min, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, and then diluted with ethyl acetate (100 mL). The organic layer was washed with 5% aqueous citric acid solution (40 mL), saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (40 mL), 5% aqueous potassium carbonate solution (2 × 40 mL), and brine (40 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude residue was subjected to silica gel chromatography eluting with 0¬100% ethyl acetate in hexanes to afford the product 7 (1.5 g, 70%).
