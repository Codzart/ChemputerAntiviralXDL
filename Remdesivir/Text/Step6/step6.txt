To a stirred solution of (S)-2-ethylbutyl 2-(((S)-(((3aR,4R,6R,6aR)-6-(4-aminopyrrolo[2,1- f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-6-cyano-2,2-dimethyltetrahydrofuro[3,4-d][1,3]dioxol-4- yl)methoxy)(phenoxy)phosphoryl)amino)propanoate (7, 12.9 g, 20.0 mmol, 1 equiv) in tetrahydrofuran (100 mL) was added 37% aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (20 mL) slowly at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. After 5 h, the reaction mixture was diluted with water (100 mL) and adjusted to pH=8 by the addition of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (200 mL). The resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL), and the organic extract was then washed with brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude residue was subjected to silica gel chromatography eluting with 0¬100% ethyl acetate in hexanes to afford GS-5734 (8.3 g, 69%).
